The modified retail food environment index table is part of a series of indicators in 
the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. 
The table contains data on the modified retail food environment index for California, its 
regions, counties, cities, towns, and census tracts. An adequate, nutritious diet is a necessity 
at all stages of life. This is important to let pregnant women and their developing babies, 
children, adolescents, adults, and older adults depend on adequate nutrition for optimum 
development and maintenance of health and functioning. The modified retail food 
environment index also works to protect the publicâ€™s health in the Golden State and helps 
shape positive health outcomes for individuals, families, and communities.

Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an 
organism. Everyone needs food to survive. Food can come from many forms and sources 
such as plants, animals or fungal origin that contains essential nutrient, such as 
carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. Not only human beings, but animals, 
plants and other organisms also need food to survive. Plants, algae, and some 
microorganisms use photosynthesis to make their food molecules. Back in ancient times, 
human can only get their food through agriculture and risked their life hunting and fishing. 
However, back in the present time, human can easily get their food in restaurants or 
supermarkets that are supplied by the industrial food industry through complex food 
processing and food distribution systems.
